# Problem 1
Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $ab + 1$ divides $a^{2} + b^{2}$. Show that $\frac {a^{2} + b^{2}}{ab + 1}$ is the square of an integer.

<h2>Solution</h2>
I'm sorry lmfao, this question's really hard, you should probably skip it, but the solution's really pretty. Watch the numberphile video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Vj_7Y2-xY">here</a>, it explains it well! <br>
Alternatively, if you really want a written solution, here it is: <br><br>
Choose integers $a,b,k$ such that $a^2+b^2=k(ab+1)$ Now, for fixed $k$, out of all pairs $(a,b)$ choose the one with the lowest value of $\min(a,b)$. Label $b'=\min(a,b), a'=\max(a,b)$. Thus, $a'^2-kb'a'+b'^2-k=0$ is a quadratic in $a'$. Should there be another root, $c'$, the root would satisfy: $b'c'\leq a'c'=b'^2-k<b'^2\implies c'<b'$ Thus, $c'$ isn't a positive integer (if it were, it would contradict the minimality condition). But $c'=kb'-a'$, so $c'$ is an integer; hence, $c'\leq 0$. In addition, $(a'+1)(c'+1)=a'c'+a'+c'+1=b'^2-k+b'k+1=b'^2+(b'-1)k+1\geq 1$ so that $c'>-1$. We conclude that $c'=0$ so that $b'^2=k$.
<br><br>
This construction works whenever there exists a solution $(a,b)$ for a fixed $k$, hence $k$ is always a perfect square.

$(x-x) \therefore \boxed{0}$

# Problem 3
Determine all natural numbers $n$, such that it's possible to insert one digit on the right side of $n$ to obtain $13n$.

<h2>Solution</h2>
Assume the number to be $abc \cdots m$. We see that the new number is $10*n+x$ where $x$ is $0$ to $9$, so we see that $3n$ is less $10$. So we see that $n$ is $0,1,2,3$</details>

# Problem 4
Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers such that $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} = 3$. Evaluate $(\frac{a+b}{a-b})^5$

<details>
<summary>Click to show solution</summary>
<h2>Solution</h2>
$\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a}=3$, so $a^2+b^2=3ab$. $(a+b)^2=5ab$, and $(a-b)^2=ab$. So $(a+b)=\pm \sqrt{5ab}$ and $(a-b)=\pm \sqrt{ab}$. Now with $ab$, it is much easier, we have $\frac{25(ab)^2\sqrt{5ab}}{(ab)^2\sqrt{ab}}=25\sqrt{5}$ as the answer
