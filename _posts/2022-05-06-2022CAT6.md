Five robots, labelled $A, B, C, D$ and $E$ are placed in an arena. The intention is to search the ground to find missing treasure, $T$.

The robots only understand two instructions:

- $F$: Move forward one square.
- $R$: Turn right.

Each is pre-programmed with the same set of instructions:

- $FR$ $FR$
- $FFR$ $FFR$
- $FFFR$ $FFFR$
- $FFFFR$ $FFFFR$
- ...
- (the pattern continues)

The robots start in the positions shown in the grid, facing the way indicated by the arrow.
