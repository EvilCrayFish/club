# Problem 1
In $\triangle BAC$, $\angle BAC=40^\circ$, $AB=10$, and $AC=6$. Points $D$ and $E$ lie on $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$ respectively. What is the minimum possible value of $BE+DE+CD$?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
Let $C_1$ be the reflection of $C$ across $\overline{AB}$, and let $C_2$ be the reflection of $C_1$ across $\overline{AC}$. Then it is well-known that the quantity $BE+DE+CD$ is minimized when it is equal to $C_2B$. (Proving this is a simple application of the triangle inequality; for an example of a simpler case, see Heron's Shortest Path Problem.) As $A$ lies on both $AB$ and $AC$, we have $C_2A=C_1A=CA=6$. Furthermore, $\angle CAC_1=2\angle CAB=80^\circ$ by the nature of the reflection, so $\angle C_2AB=\angle C_2AC+\angle CAB=80^\circ+40^\circ=120^\circ$. Therefore by the Law of Cosines \[BC_2^2=6^2+10^2-2\cdot 6\cdot 10\cos 120^\circ=196\implies BC_2=14.\]

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
In $\triangle BAC$, the three lines look like the Chinese character Âèà. Let $\triangle DEA$, $\triangle CDA$, and $\triangle BEA$ have bases $DE$, $CD$, and $BE$ respectively. Then, $\triangle DEA$ has the same side $DA$ as $\triangle CDA$ and the same side $EA$ as $\triangle BEA$. Connect all three triangles with $\triangle DEA$ in the center and the two triangles sharing one of its sides. Then, the pentagon $BACDE$ is formed with $BE+DE+CD$ forming the base. <br><br>

Intuitively, the pentagon's base is minimized when all three bottom sides are collinear. This is simply the original $\triangle BAC$ except that $\angle BAC =120^\circ$. (In $\triangle DEA$, $\triangle CDA$, and $\triangle BEA$, $\angle A = 40^\circ$, and the three triangles connect at $A$ to form the pentagon). Thus, $m\angle BAC = 40 * 3$). <br><br><br>


$BC$ in this new triangle is then the minimum of $BE+DE+CD$. Applying law of cosines, $BC=\sqrt{6^2+10^2-2(6)(10)\cos (120^\circ)}=\sqrt{196}=14$

Reflect $C$ across $AB$ to $C'$. Similarly, reflect $B$ across $AC$ to $B'$. Clearly, $BE = B'E$ and $CD = C'D$. Thus, the sum $BE + DE + CD = B'E + DE + C'D$. This value is minimized when $B'$, $C'$, $D$ and $E$ are collinear. To finish, we use the law of cosines on the triangle $AB'C'$: $B'C' = \sqrt{6^2 + 10^2 - 2(6)(10)\cos 120} = 14$
