# Problem 1
Find all arrangements of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \cdots, 2n$ around a circle so that the difference between any two numbers next to each other is at most $2$.

<h2>Solution</h2>
Without loss of generality, put the number 1 at the 12 o'clock mark of the circle. Then the numbers 2 and 3 must appear to the left and right of 1. Assume 2 is to the right, and 3 is to the left. Going clockwise, the only remaining number which can go next to 2 is 4 , and so going anti-clockwise, 5 must appear next to 3 . This pattern continues with the right half of the circle containing, in order, the numbers $2,4,6, \ldots, 2 n$, and the left half, going anti-clockwise from the top, $1,3,5, \ldots,(2 n-1) .$ A second solution is a reflection of this result around a vertical line passing through 1 and $2 n$. Hence there are two arrangements.

# Problem 2
In order to attract more students, Caulfield Grammar School opens a new campus where they arrange $1000$ lockers in a line in a long corridor, numbered from $1$ to $1000$. <br>
Initially, all the lockers are closed (but unlocked). <br>
The first student walks along the corridor and opens every locker. <br>
The second student then walks along the corridor and closes every second locker, i.e. closes lockers $2, 4, 6,$ etc. At that point, there are $500$ lockers that are open and $500$ that are closed.<br>
The third student then walks along the corridor, changing the state of every third locker. Thus, they close locker $3$ (which had been left open by the first student), open locker $6$ (closed by the second student), close locker $9$, etc. <br><br>
How many lockers are closed immediately after the fourth student has walked along the corridor?
