# Problem 1
At a gathering of $30$ people, there are $20$ people who all know each other and $10$ people who know no one. People who know each other hug, and people who do not know each other shake hands. How many handshakes occur within the group?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
Each one of the ten people has to shake hands with all the $20$ other people they don’t know. So $10\cdot20 = 200$. From there, we calculate how many handshakes occurred between the people who don’t know each other. This is simply counting how many ways to choose two people to shake hands from $10$, or $\binom{10}{2} = 45$. Thus the answer is $200 + 45 = \boxed{245}$.
<br>
<h2>Solution 2</h2>
We can also use complementary counting. First of all, $\dbinom{30}{2}=435$ handshakes or hugs occur. Then, if we can find the number of hugs, then we can subtract it from $435$ to find the handshakes. Hugs only happen between the $20$ people who know each other, so there are $\dbinom{20}{2}=190$ hugs. $435-190= \boxed{245}$.
<br>
<h2>Solution 3</h2>
We can focus on how many handshakes the $10$ people who don't know anybody get.
<br>
The first person gets $29$ handshakes with other people not him/herself, the second person gets $28$ handshakes with other people not him/herself and not the first person, ..., and the tenth receives $20$ handshakes with other people not him/herself and not the first, second, ..., ninth person. We can write this as the sum of an arithmetic sequence:
<br>
$\frac{10(20+29)}{2}\implies 5(49)\implies 245.$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{245}$
<br>
<h2>Solution 4</h2>
First, we can find out the number of handshakes that the $10$ people who don't know anybody share with the $20$ other people. This is simply $10 \cdot 20 = 200$. Next, we need to find out the number of handshakes that are shared within the $10$ people who don't know anybody. Here, we can use the formula $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of people being counted. The reason we divide by $2$ is because $n(n-1)$ counts the case where the $1^{st}$ person shakes hands with the $2^{nd}$ person $and$ the case where the $2^{nd}$ shakes hands with the $1^{st}$ (and these 2 cases are the same). Thus, plugging $n=10$ gives us $\frac{10 \cdot 9}{2} \implies 45$. Adding up the 2 cases gives us $200+45=\boxed{245}$

# Problem 2
Real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $x^2+y^2=10x-6y-34$. What is $x+y$?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
If we move every term dependent on $x$ or $y$ to the LHS, we get $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34$. Adding $34$ to both sides, we have $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + 34 = 0$. We can split the $34$ into $25$ and $9$ to get $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0$. Notice this is a circle with radius $0$, which only contains one point. So, the only point is $(5, -3)$, so the sum is $5 + (-3) = 2$.
<br>
<h2>Solution 2</h2>
If we move every term including $x$ or $y$ to the LHS, we get \[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34.\] We can complete the square to find that this equation becomes \[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0.\] Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, we know that the sum is greater than or equal to $0$. Equality holds when the value inside the parhentheses is equal to $0$. We find that \[(x,y) = (5,-3)\] and the sum we are looking for is \[5+(-3)=2.\]

# Problem 3
Here is a pattern of structures created by putting matchsticks together. The first pattern is made by connecting the ends of 3 matchsticks together.
<br><br><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2022Week6Junior1.png" style="filter: invert(100%);"/>

1. How many matchsticks are required to make the 4th and 5th structure?
2. What is the correlation between the number of matchsticks used and the pattern number?
3. How many matchsticks are needed to make the 100th structure?

# Problem 4

Here is another structure of steps created by putting matchsticks together.

1. How many matchsticks are required to make the 4th and 5th step?
2. How many matchsticks are needed for the 100th step?
