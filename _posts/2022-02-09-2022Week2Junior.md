The height of the triangle is $y = 6$, and the width of the triangle is $|x_1| + |x_2| = 2y = 12$. Thus the area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 12 = 36$.

# Problem 2
Squares $ABCD$, $EFGH$, and $GHIJ$ are equal in area. Points $C$ and $D$ are the midpoints of sides $IH$ and $HE$, respectively. What is the ratio of the area of the shaded pentagon $AJICB$ to the sum of the areas of the three squares?

We can see that the Pentagon is made of two congruent shapes. We can fit one triangle into the gap in the upper square. Therefore, the answer is just $\frac{1}{3}$

<h2>Alternatively</h2>

First let $s=2$ (where $s$ is the side length of the squares) for simplicity. We can extend $\overline{IJ}$ until it hits the extension of $\overline{AB}$. Call this point $X$. The area of triangle $AXJ$ then is $\dfrac{3 \cdot 4}{2}$ The area of rectangle $BXIC$ is $2 \cdot 1 = 2$. Thus, our desired area is $6-2 = 4$. Now, the ratio of the shaded area to the combined area of the three squares is $\frac{4}{3\cdot 2^2} = \frac{1}{3}$.
