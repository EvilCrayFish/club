A researcher is analysing several samples of earthworm genes, trying to isolate those that are the most unique relative to their peers.

(A gene is represented as a sequence of letters $A$, $C$, $G$ and $T$.)

One of her samples contains $\text{A C G T A}$, $\text{A G C T G}$ and $\text{T G A T G}$. Our researcher is examining the uniqueness of the first one. She lines them up and gives the specimen a 'uniqueness code'.

| Specimen | $A$        | $C$        | $G$        | $T$        | $A$        |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Peers    | $A$<br>$T$ | $G$<br>$G$ | $C$<br>$A$ | $T$<br>$T$ | $G$<br>$G$ |
| Code     | 1          | 0          | 0          | 2          | 0          |

- The first A is found in that position in one other gene, hence the l.
- The C is found in that position in no other gene, hence the 0.
- etc.

Her next sample contains the genes:
- $\text{C A G T A}$,
- $\text{A G G C A}$,
- $\text{C G G A T}$,
- $\text{A T G T T}$,
- $\text{A T A G G}$.

Which specimen has a uniqueness code of $\text{2 1 3 1 1}$?

$$
\textbf{(a)}\ \text{C A G T A}\qquad\textbf{(b)}\ \text{A G G C A}\qquad\textbf{(c)}\ \text{C G G A T}
$$

$$
\qquad\textbf{(d)}\ \text{A T G T T}\qquad\textbf{(e)}\ \text{A T A G G}
$$
