Darian is playing a board game on a large checkerboard that has been rotated by $45Â°$.

On each turn, he can move his counter one square in any of the eight compass directions shown: north ($N$), north-east ($NE$), east ($E$), south-east ($SE$), south ($S$), south-west ($SW$), west ($W$) and north-west ($NW$).

To keep track of his progress, Darian writes down each of the moves using the shortcuts above. Unfortunately, he forgets to put a space or comma between the symbols, so it's not always clear exactly what the individual moves are.

In how many different squares could his counter finish with the following instructions?

$$
\textbf{(a)}\ \text{NWNNNWEENW}\qquad\textbf{(b)}\ \text{NWNNWESENNWSE}
$$

$$
\qquad\textbf{(c)}\ \text{NSNEWSNWEWSSWEN}
$$
