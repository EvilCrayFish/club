# Problem 1
Find the smallest multiple of nine containing only even digits.

<details>
<summary>Click to show solution</summary>
If a number is divisible by nine then the sum of digits must be a multiple of nine.
<br><br>
But if all of the digits are even then they must sum to an even multiple of nine, and the smallest even multiple of nine is eighteen.
<br><br>
Hence we are looking for the most efficient way to write eighteen as the sum of even digits: 2 + 8 + 8. That is, the smallest multiple of nine containing only even digits is 288.
<br><br>
Find the first five multiples of nine containing only even digits.

# Problem 2
The sum of the first $n$ squares, $1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.

For example, $1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 10^2 = \frac{10 \times 11 \times 21}{6} = 385$.

Prove that $n(n+1)(2n+1)$ is divisible by six for all integer values, $n$.

To prove that $n(n+1)(2n+1)$ is divisible by $6$ we must show that it is divisible by both $2$ and $3$.
<br><br>
As $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers then exactly one of them will be even and thus divisible by $2$.
<br><br>
If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ is divisible by $3$ then $n+2$ will be. Therefore $2(n+2)=2n+4$ and $2n+4-3=2n+1$ will be divisible by $3$.
<br><br>
Hence $n(n+1)(2n+1)$ is divisible by both $2$ and $3$.
