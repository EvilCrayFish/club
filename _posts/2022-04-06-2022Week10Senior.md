# Problem 1
Consider the following statement: <br> <br>
(\*) If $f(x)$ is an integer for every integer $x$, then $f^{\prime}(x)$ is an integer for every integer $x$. <br> <br>
Which one of the following is a counterexample to (\*) ? <br> <br>
A $f(x)=\frac{x^{3}+x+1}{4}$ <br>
B $f(x)=\frac{x^{4}+x^{2}+x}{2}$ <br>
C $f(x)=\frac{x^{4}+x^{3}+x^{2}+x}{2}$ <br>
D $f(x)=\frac{x^{4}+2 x^{3}+x^{2}}{4}$ <br>

# Problem 2
For any positive integer $k$, let $f_1(k)$ denote the square of the sum of the digits of $k$. For $n \ge 2$, let $f_n(k) = f_1(f_{n - 1}(k))$. Find $f_{1988}(11)$.

We see that $f_{1}(11)=4$
<br><br>
$f_2(11) = f_1(4)=16$
<br><br>
$f_3(11) = f_1(16)=49$
<br><br>
$f_4(11) = f_1(49)=169$
<br><br>
$f_5(11) = f_1(169)=256$
<br><br>
$f_6(11) = f_1(256)=169$
<br><br>
Note that this revolves between the two numbers. Since $1988$ is even, we thus have $f_{1988}(11) = f_{4}(11) = \boxed{169}$.
