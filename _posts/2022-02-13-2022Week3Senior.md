# Problem 1
Real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $x^2+y^2=10x-6y-34$. What is $x+y$?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
If we move every term dependent on $x$ or $y$ to the LHS, we get $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34$. Adding $34$ to both sides, we have $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + 34 = 0$. We can split the $34$ into $25$ and $9$ to get $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0$. Notice this is a circle with radius $0$, which only contains one point. So, the only point is $(5, -3)$, so the sum is $5 + (-3) = 2$.

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
If we move every term including $x$ or $y$ to the LHS, we get \[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34.\] We can complete the square to find that this equation becomes \[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0.\] Since the square of any real number is non-negative, we know that the sum is greater than or equal to $0$. Equality holds when the value inside the parentheses is equal to $0$. We find that \[(x,y) = (5,-3)\] and the sum we are looking for is \[5+(-3)=2\]
