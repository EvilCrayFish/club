# Problem 1
Real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $x^2+y^2=10x-6y-34$. What is $x+y$?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
If we move every term dependent on $x$ or $y$ to the LHS, we get $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34$. Adding $34$ to both sides, we have $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + 34 = 0$. We can split the $34$ into $25$ and $9$ to get $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0$. Notice this is a circle with radius $0$, which only contains one point. So, the only point is $(5, -3)$, so the sum is $5 + (-3) = 2$.

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
If we move every term including $x$ or $y$ to the LHS, we get \[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34.\] We can complete the square to find that this equation becomes \[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0.\] Since the square of any real number is non-negative, we know that the sum is greater than or equal to $0$. Equality holds when the value inside the parentheses is equal to $0$. We find that \[(x,y) = (5,-3)\] and the sum we are looking for is \[5+(-3)=2\]

# Problem 2
In $\triangle ABC$, $AB = 6$, $BC = 7$, and $CA = 8$. Point $D$ lies on $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{AD}$ bisects $\angle BAC$. Point $E$ lies on $\overline{AC}$, and $\overline{BE}$ bisects $\angle ABC$. The bisectors intersect at $F$. What is the ratio $AF$ : $FD$?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
By the angle bisector theorem, $\frac{AB}{AE} = \frac{CB}{CE}$ <br>

$\frac{6}{AE} = \frac{7}{8 - AE}$ so $AE = \frac{48}{13}$ <br>

Similarly, $CD = 4$. <br> <br>

There are two ways to solve from here. <br>

<h3>First way:</h3>

Note that $DB = 7 - 4 = 3.$ By the angle bisector theorem on $\triangle ADB,$ $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{DB} = \frac{6}{3}.$ Thus the answer is $2 : 1$ <br>

<h3>Second way:</h3>

Now, we use mass points. Assign point $C$ a mass of $1$. <br>

$mC \cdot CD = mB \cdot DB$ , so $mB = \frac{4}{3}$ <br>

Similarly, $A$ will have a mass of $\frac{7}{6}$ <br>

$mD = mC + mB = 1 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{7}{3}$ <br>

So $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{mD}{mA} = 2 : 1$ <br>
<br>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
Denote $[\triangle{ABC}]$ as the area of triangle ABC and let $r$ be the inradius. Also, as above, use the angle bisector theorem to find that $BD = 3$. There are two ways to continue from here: <br><br>

$1.$ Note that $F$ is the incenter. Then, $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{[\triangle{AFB}]}{[\triangle{BFD}]} = \frac{AB * \frac{r}{2}}{BD * \frac{r}{2}} = \frac{AB}{BD} = 2 : 1$ <br> <br>

$2.$ Apply the angle bisector theorem on $\triangle{ABD}$ to get $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 : 1$ <br>
<br>

<h2>Solution 3</h2>
Draw the third angle bisector, and denote the point where this bisector intersects $AB$ as $P$. Using angle bisector theorem, we see $AE=48/13 , EC=56/13, AP=16/5, PB=14/5$. Applying Van Aubel's Theorem, $AF/FD=(48/13)/(56/13) + (16/5)/(14/5)=(6/7)+(8/7)=14/7=2/1$, and so the answer is $2 : 1$.
<br><br>

<h2>Solution 4</h2>
One only needs the angle bisector theorem to solve this question.

The question asks for $AF:FD = \frac{AF}{FD}$. Apply the angle bisector theorem to $\triangle ABD$ to get \[\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{BD}.\]

$AB = 6$ is given. To find $BD$, apply the angle bisector theorem to $\triangle BAC$ to get \[\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{BA}{AC} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}.\]

Since \[BD + DC = BC = 7,\] it is immediately obvious that $BD = 3$, $DC = 4$ satisfies both equations.

Thus, \[AF:FD = AB:BD = 6:3 = 2 : 1.\]
