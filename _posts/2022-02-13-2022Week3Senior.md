<h2>Solution 1</h2>
If we move every term dependent on $x$ or $y$ to the LHS, we get $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34$. Adding $34$ to both sides, we have $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + 34 = 0$. We can split the $34$ into $25$ and $9$ to get $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0$. Notice this is a circle with radius $0$, which only contains one point. So, the only point is $(5, -3)$, so the sum is $5 + (-3) = 2$.
<br>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
If we move every term including $x$ or $y$ to the LHS, we get \[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34.\] We can complete the square to find that this equation becomes \[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0.\] Since the square of any real number is non-negative, we know that the sum is greater than or equal to $0$. Equality holds when the value inside the parentheses is equal to $0$. We find that \[(x,y) = (5,-3)\] and the sum we are looking for is \[5+(-3)=2\]

# Problem 2
In $\triangle ABC$, $AB = 6$, $BC = 7$, and $CA = 8$. Point $D$ lies on $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{AD}$ bisects $\angle BAC$. Point $E$ lies on $\overline{AC}$, and $\overline{BE}$ bisects $\angle ABC$. The bisectors intersect at $F$. What is the ratio $AF$ : $FD$?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
By the angle bisector theorem, $\frac{AB}{AE} = \frac{CB}{CE}$ <br>

$\frac{6}{AE} = \frac{7}{8 - AE}$ so $AE = \frac{48}{13}$ <br>

Similarly, $CD = 4$. <br> <br>

There are two ways to solve from here. <br>

<h3>First way:</h3>

Note that $DB = 7 - 4 = 3.$ By the angle bisector theorem on $\triangle ADB,$ $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{DB} = \frac{6}{3}.$ Thus the answer is $2 : 1$ <br>

<h3>Second way:</h3>

Now, we use mass points. Assign point $C$ a mass of $1$. <br>

$mC \cdot CD = mB \cdot DB$ , so $mB = \frac{4}{3}$ <br>

Similarly, $A$ will have a mass of $\frac{7}{6}$ <br>

$mD = mC + mB = 1 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{7}{3}$ <br>

So $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{mD}{mA} = 2 : 1$ <br>
<br>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
Denote $[\triangle{ABC}]$ as the area of triangle ABC and let $r$ be the inradius. Also, as above, use the angle bisector theorem to find that $BD = 3$. There are two ways to continue from here: <br><br>

$1.$ Note that $F$ is the incenter. Then, $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{[\triangle{AFB}]}{[\triangle{BFD}]} = \frac{AB * \frac{r}{2}}{BD * \frac{r}{2}} = \frac{AB}{BD} = 2 : 1$ <br> <br>

$2.$ Apply the angle bisector theorem on $\triangle{ABD}$ to get $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 : 1$ <br>
<br>

<h2>Solution 3</h2>
Draw the third angle bisector, and denote the point where this bisector intersects $AB$ as $P$. Using angle bisector theorem, we see $AE=48/13 , EC=56/13, AP=16/5, PB=14/5$. Applying Van Aubel's Theorem, $AF/FD=(48/13)/(56/13) + (16/5)/(14/5)=(6/7)+(8/7)=14/7=2/1$, and so the answer is $2 : 1$.
<br><br>

<h2>Solution 4</h2>
One only needs the angle bisector theorem to solve this question.

The question asks for $AF:FD = \frac{AF}{FD}$. Apply the angle bisector theorem to $\triangle ABD$ to get \[\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{BD}.\]

$AB = 6$ is given. To find $BD$, apply the angle bisector theorem to $\triangle BAC$ to get \[\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{BA}{AC} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}.\]

Since \[BD + DC = BC = 7,\] it is immediately obvious that $BD = 3$, $DC = 4$ satisfies both equations.

Thus, \[AF:FD = AB:BD = 6:3 = 2 : 1.\]

# Problem 3
A regular polygon, of side-length 1, has 2014 sides. The inscribed circle is the largest circle that can be drawn inside the polygon, and so touches every edge at its mid-point. The circumscribed circle is the smallest circle that can be drawn outside the polygon, and so touches every vertex of the polygon. Calculate the area enclosed between the two circles.

# Problem 4
A ride at an amusement park consists of a small circle which rotates inside a large circle. The large circle, of radius 100 metres, is tangent to the ground at its lowest point, and remains fixed in place throughout the ride. The smaller circle has radius 20 metres. It is initially tangent to the larger circle at its lowest point. Ada sits in the ride at this tangent point, on a seat attached to the smaller circle. When the ride starts, the smaller circle rolls around the larger circle without slipping, so that the circles always remain tangent, and Ada rotates with the smaller circle, as illustrated below.
<br><br><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/hsadjhghdsaj.png" style="filter: invert(100%);"><br>
When the centre of the smaller circle has rotated 120â—¦ around the centre of the larger circle, how far in metres is Ada off the ground?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
Ada's final and initial positions are shown below. The centre of the larger circle is denoted $O$; the final position of the centre of smaller circle is denoted $C$; Ada's final position is denoted $E$. We drop a vertical line from $E$, denoting the point at the same height as $C$ by $D$. Similarly, we drop a vertical line from $C$, denoting the point at the same height as $O$ by $B$. <br><br>

<br><br><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/hjjhasgdjkhjgsa.png" style="filter: invert(100%);"><br>

The arc traversed on the larger circle has length $100 \times \frac{2 \pi}{3}=\frac{200 \pi}{3}$. The circumference of the smaller circle is $40 \pi$. Since the smaller circle rotates without slipping, Ada's seat has rotated about the smaller circle's centre, and relative to the point of tangency of the two circles, through an angle of $360 \times \frac{200 \pi}{3} / 40 \pi=120 \times 5=600^{\circ}$. As $600=360+240$, this is one full revolution, plus a further $240^{\circ}$. Hence Ada's final position is $240^{\circ}$ clockwise from the point of tangency of the two circles, as shown. <br><br>
Ada's height off the ground is $A O+B C+D E$. Now $A O$ is the radius of the larger circle, which is $100 \mathrm{~m}$. Since $\angle B O C=120-90=30^{\circ}$, triangle $B O C$ has angles $30^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}$. Its hypotenuse $O C$ is the difference between the radii of the circles, hence $100-20=80$. So, noting that $B O C$ is half an equilateral triangle of side length 80 , we observe $B C=40 \mathrm{~m}$. <br><br>
Since $O B$ and $C D$ are parallel, $\angle D C O=\angle C O B=30^{\circ}$. So $\angle D C E=240-30-180=30^{\circ}$. Thus triangle $C D E$ has angles $30^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}$ and its hypotenuse is the radius of the smaller circle, 20. Again, recognising half an equilateral triangle, we obtain $D E=C E / 2=10$. <br><br>
Thus Ada's height off the ground, in metres, is $A O+B C+D E=100+40+10=\mathbf{1 5 0}$.
<br><br>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
Ada's final and initial positions are shown below. The centre of the larger circle is denoted $O$; the final position of the centre of smaller circle is denoted $C$; Ada's final position is denoted $E$; the point of tangency of the two circles is denoted $T$. In $\triangle O S T, O S$ is horizontal and $S T$ is vertical. So $\angle S O T=120-90=30^{\circ}$. <br><br>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/jknsmbgh.png" style="filter: invert(100%);"><br>

The arc traversed on the larger circle has length $100 \times \frac{2 \pi}{3}=\frac{200 \pi}{3}$. The circumference of the smaller circle is $40 \pi$. Since the smaller circle rotates without slipping, Ada's seat has rotated about the smaller circle's centre, and relative to the point of tangency of the two circles, through an angle of $360 \times \frac{200 \pi}{3} / 40 \pi=120 \times 5=600^{\circ}$. As $600=360+240$, this is one full revolution, plus a further $240^{\circ}$. Hence Ada's final position is $240^{\circ}$ clockwise from $T$, as shown. <br><br>

Since $C T$ is at $30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, the angle at which $E C$ is above the horizontal is $240-180-30=30^{\circ}$. So $E$ and $T$ are at the same height above the ground. <br><br>

Since $\triangle O S T$ has angles $30^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}$, it is half an equilateral triangle with side length 100 , hence $S T=O T / 2=50 \mathrm{~m}$. So Ada's height above the ground, in metres, is $T S+O A=50+100=\mathbf{1 5 0}$. <br><br>

<h3>Comment</h3>
The curve that Ada follows is called a hypocycloid. Students who know some trigonometry might know the parametric equations for a hypocycloid. <br><br>

Let $R$ be the radius of the large circle and $r$ the radius of the small circle. Place the centre of the large circle at the origin of Cartesian axes and start Ada at $(R, 0)$. Let $\theta$ be the angle from the positive $x$-axis to the line through the centres of both circles. Then the Cartesian coordinates for Ada are: <br><br>
$$
\begin{aligned}
&x=(R-r) \cos \theta+r \cos \left(\frac{R-r}{r} \theta\right) \\
&y=(R-r) \sin \theta-r \sin \left(\frac{R-r}{r} \theta\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
<br> In the present problem, we have $R=100, r=20$, and we want the $x$-coordinate when $\theta=120^{\circ}$. So $x=80 \cos 120+20 \cos (4 \times 120)=80 \cos 120+20 \cos 120=100 \cos 120=-50$. Hence the required height for Ada is $100+50=150$.
