# Problem 1
Note: This problem concerns dates of the form $d_{1}d_{2}/m_{1}m_{2}/y_{1}y_{2}y_{3}y_{4}$ in the order day month year, using the Gregorian Calendar. <br><br>
Mr Hannah loves the dates which contain no repetitions of a digit. For example, the date $23/05/1967$ is one such date but $07/12/1974$ is not. <br>
He wants to figure out how many such dates there were in the years from 1900 to 1999, could you help?

<h2>Solution</h2>
Let's consider dates of the form $d_{1} d_{2} / m_{1} m_{2} / 19 y_{3} y_{4}$. Clearly $m_{1}=0$. If $d_{1}=3$, then $d_{2}=0$ or 1 , either of which would be a repetition. Hence $d_{1}=2$. We therefore have dates of the form $2 d_{2} / 0 m_{2} / 19 y_{3} y_{4}$. The remaining spaces can be filled with arbitrary distinct values from $3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3=360$ possibilities; each such possibility is a valid date.
