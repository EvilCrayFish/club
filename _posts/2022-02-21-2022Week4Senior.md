# Problem 1
Note: This problem concerns dates of the form $d_{1}d_{2}/m_{1}m_{2}/y_{1}y_{2}y_{3}y_{4}$ in the order day month year, using the Gregorian Calendar. <br><br>
Mr Hannah loves the dates which contain no repetitions of a digit. For example, the date $23/05/1967$ is one such date but $07/12/1974$ is not. <br>
He wants to figure out how many such dates there were in the years from 1900 to 1999, could you help?

<h2>Solution</h2>
Let's consider dates of the form $d_{1} d_{2} / m_{1} m_{2} / 19 y_{3} y_{4}$. Clearly $m_{1}=0$. If $d_{1}=3$, then $d_{2}=0$ or 1 , either of which would be a repetition. Hence $d_{1}=2$. We therefore have dates of the form $2 d_{2} / 0 m_{2} / 19 y_{3} y_{4}$. The remaining spaces can be filled with arbitrary distinct values from $3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3=360$ possibilities; each such possibility is a valid date.

# Problem 2:
On Mr McCarty's new phone, a passlock consists of six circles arranged in a $2 \times 3$ rectangle. The lock is opened by a continuous path connecting the six circles; the path cannot pass through a circle on the way between two others (e.g. the top left and right circles cannot be adjacent). For example, the left path shown below is allowed but the right path is not. (Paths are considered to be oriented, so that a path starting at $A$ and ending at $B$ is different from a path starting at $B$ and ending at $A$. However, in the diagrams below, the paths are valid/invalid regardless of orientation.) How many passlocks are there consisting of all six circles?
