Packages of different weights arrive at a warehouse. The packages need to be stored on a table in a pile with each package being lighter than each of the ones below it. However, for a short time, as they are being sorted, it is sometimes necessary to put heavier parcels on top of lighter ones. There is only enough space for one other table.

The only options are to place a new package on a table or move the top package from one table to the other table.

For example, if packages arrive in order with weights of 1, 2 and 3 kg, they could be stored on the left-hand table with five movements as shown:

What is the smallest number of movements needed to arrange the packages on one table, in order from lightest to heaviest, for the following arrivals?

$$
\textbf{(a)}\ 1, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3\qquad\textbf{(b)}\ 3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4
$$

$$
\qquad\textbf{(c)}\ 4, 2, 1, 3, 5
