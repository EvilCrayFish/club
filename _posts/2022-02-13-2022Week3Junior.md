# Problem 1
Cities $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ are connected by roads $\widetilde{AB}$, $\widetilde{AD}$, $\widetilde{AE}$, $\widetilde{BC}$, $\widetilde{BD}$, $\widetilde{CD}$, and $\widetilde{DE}$. How many different routes are there from $A$ to $B$ that use each road exactly once? (Such a route will necessarily visit some cities more than once.)

<h2>Solution</h2>
Note that cities $C$ and $E$ can be removed when counting paths because if a path goes in to $C$ or $E$, there is only one possible path to take out of cities $C$ or $E$. So the diagram is as follows:

Now we proceed with casework. Remember that there are two ways to travel from $A$ to $D$, $D$ to $A$, $B$ to $D$ and $D$ to $B$:
<br><br>
<h3>Case 1</h3>
$A \Rightarrow D$: From $D$, if the path returns to $A$, then the next path must go to $B\Rightarrow D \Rightarrow B$. There are $2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4$ possibilities of the path $ADABDB$. If the path goes to $D$ from $B$, then the path must continue with either $BDAB$ or $BADB$. There are $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$ possibilities. So, this case gives $4+8=12$ different possibilities.
<br><br>
<h3>Case 2</h3>
$A \Rightarrow B$: The path must continue with $BDADB$. There are $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ possibilities for this case.
<br><br>
Putting the two cases together gives $12+4 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} \ 16}$

# Problem 3
A ride at an amusement park consists of a small circle which rotates inside a large circle. The large circle, of radius 100 metres, is tangent to the ground at its lowest point, and remains fixed in place throughout the ride. The smaller circle has radius 20 metres. It is initially tangent to the larger circle at its lowest point. Ada sits in the ride at this tangent point, on a seat attached to the smaller circle. When the ride starts, the smaller circle rolls around the larger circle without slipping, so that the circles always remain tangent, and Ada rotates with the smaller circle, as illustrated below.

When the centre of the smaller circle has rotated 120â—¦ around the centre of the larger circle, how far in metres is Ada off the ground?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
Ada's final and initial positions are shown below. The centre of the larger circle is denoted $O$; the final position of the centre of smaller circle is denoted $C$; Ada's final position is denoted $E$. We drop a vertical line from $E$, denoting the point at the same height as $C$ by $D$. Similarly, we drop a vertical line from $C$, denoting the point at the same height as $O$ by $B$. <br><br>

<br><br><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/hjjhasgdjkhjgsa.png" style="filter: invert(100%);"><br>

The arc traversed on the larger circle has length $100 \times \frac{2 \pi}{3}=\frac{200 \pi}{3}$. The circumference of the smaller circle is $40 \pi$. Since the smaller circle rotates without slipping, Ada's seat has rotated about the smaller circle's centre, and relative to the point of tangency of the two circles, through an angle of $360 \times \frac{200 \pi}{3} / 40 \pi=120 \times 5=600^{\circ}$. As $600=360+240$, this is one full revolution, plus a further $240^{\circ}$. Hence Ada's final position is $240^{\circ}$ clockwise from the point of tangency of the two circles, as shown. <br><br>
Ada's height off the ground is $A O+B C+D E$. Now $A O$ is the radius of the larger circle, which is $100 \mathrm{~m}$. Since $\angle B O C=120-90=30^{\circ}$, triangle $B O C$ has angles $30^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}$. Its hypotenuse $O C$ is the difference between the radii of the circles, hence $100-20=80$. So, noting that $B O C$ is half an equilateral triangle of side length 80 , we observe $B C=40 \mathrm{~m}$. <br><br>
Since $O B$ and $C D$ are parallel, $\angle D C O=\angle C O B=30^{\circ}$. So $\angle D C E=240-30-180=30^{\circ}$. Thus triangle $C D E$ has angles $30^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}$ and its hypotenuse is the radius of the smaller circle, 20. Again, recognising half an equilateral triangle, we obtain $D E=C E / 2=10$. <br><br>
Thus Ada's height off the ground, in metres, is $A O+B C+D E=100+40+10=\mathbf{1 5 0}$.
<br><br>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
Ada's final and initial positions are shown below. The centre of the larger circle is denoted $O$; the final position of the centre of smaller circle is denoted $C$; Ada's final position is denoted $E$; the point of tangency of the two circles is denoted $T$. In $\triangle O S T, O S$ is horizontal and $S T$ is vertical. So $\angle S O T=120-90=30^{\circ}$. <br><br>

The arc traversed on the larger circle has length $100 \times \frac{2 \pi}{3}=\frac{200 \pi}{3}$. The circumference of the smaller circle is $40 \pi$. Since the smaller circle rotates without slipping, Ada's seat has rotated about the smaller circle's centre, and relative to the point of tangency of the two circles, through an angle of $360 \times \frac{200 \pi}{3} / 40 \pi=120 \times 5=600^{\circ}$. As $600=360+240$, this is one full revolution, plus a further $240^{\circ}$. Hence Ada's final position is $240^{\circ}$ clockwise from $T$, as shown. <br><br>

Since $C T$ is at $30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, the angle at which $E C$ is above the horizontal is $240-180-30=30^{\circ}$. So $E$ and $T$ are at the same height above the ground. <br><br>

Since $\triangle O S T$ has angles $30^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}$, it is half an equilateral triangle with side length 100 , hence $S T=O T / 2=50 \mathrm{~m}$. So Ada's height above the ground, in metres, is $T S+O A=50+100=\mathbf{1 5 0}$. <br><br>

<h3>Comment</h3>
The curve that Ada follows is called a hypocycloid. Students who know some trigonometry might know the parametric equations for a hypocycloid. <br><br>

Let $R$ be the radius of the large circle and $r$ the radius of the small circle. Place the centre of the large circle at the origin of Cartesian axes and start Ada at $(R, 0)$. Let $\theta$ be the angle from the positive $x$-axis to the line through the centres of both circles. Then the Cartesian coordinates for Ada are: <br><br>
$$
\begin{aligned}
&x=(R-r) \cos \theta+r \cos \left(\frac{R-r}{r} \theta\right) \\
&y=(R-r) \sin \theta-r \sin \left(\frac{R-r}{r} \theta\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
<br> In the present problem, we have $R=100, r=20$, and we want the $x$-coordinate when $\theta=120^{\circ}$. So $x=80 \cos 120+20 \cos (4 \times 120)=80 \cos 120+20 \cos 120=100 \cos 120=-50$. Hence the required height for Ada is $100+50=150$.

# Problem 4
Hannah, Ivan and Jefferson are collecting shells on Barbados island. Hannah collected $\frac{11}{19}$ of the total shells. the rest was shared by Ivan and Jefferson in a ratio of $13:11$. if Hannah collected 44 more shells, then Jefferson what is the total number of shells they collected altogether?
