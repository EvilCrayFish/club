# Problem 1
Cities $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ are connected by roads $\widetilde{AB}$, $\widetilde{AD}$, $\widetilde{AE}$, $\widetilde{BC}$, $\widetilde{BD}$, $\widetilde{CD}$, and $\widetilde{DE}$. How many different routes are there from $A$ to $B$ that use each road exactly once? (Such a route will necessarily visit some cities more than once.)

<h2>Solution</h2>
Note that cities $C$ and $E$ can be removed when counting paths because if a path goes in to $C$ or $E$, there is only one possible path to take out of cities $C$ or $E$. So the diagram is as follows:

Now we proceed with casework. Remember that there are two ways to travel from $A$ to $D$, $D$ to $A$, $B$ to $D$ and $D$ to $B$:
<br><br>
<h3>Case 1</h3>
$A \Rightarrow D$: From $D$, if the path returns to $A$, then the next path must go to $B\Rightarrow D \Rightarrow B$. There are $2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4$ possibilities of the path $ADABDB$. If the path goes to $D$ from $B$, then the path must continue with either $BDAB$ or $BADB$. There are $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$ possibilities. So, this case gives $4+8=12$ different possibilities.
<br><br>
<h3>Case 2</h3>
$A \Rightarrow B$: The path must continue with $BDADB$. There are $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ possibilities for this case.
<br><br>
Putting the two cases together gives $12+4 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} \ 16}$
