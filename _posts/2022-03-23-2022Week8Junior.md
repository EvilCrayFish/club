# Problem 3
Determine all natural numbers $n$, such that it's possible to insert one digit on the right side of $n$ to obtain $13n$.

<h2>Solution</h2>
Assume the number to be $abc \cdots m$. We see that the new number is $10*n+x$ where $x$ is $0$ to $9$, so we see that $3n$ is less $10$. So we see that $n$ is $0,1,2,3$</details>

# Problem 4
Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers such that $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} = 3$. Evaluate $(\frac{a+b}{a-b})^5$

<details>
<summary>Click to show solution</summary>
<h2>Solution</h2>
$\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a}=3$, so $a^2+b^2=3ab$. $(a+b)^2=5ab$, and $(a-b)^2=ab$. So $(a+b)=\pm \sqrt{5ab}$ and $(a-b)=\pm \sqrt{ab}$. Now with $ab$, it is much easier, we have $\frac{25(ab)^2\sqrt{5ab}}{(ab)^2\sqrt{ab}}=25\sqrt{5}$ as the answer
