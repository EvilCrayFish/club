# Problem 1
Let the positive integer $N$ be given by $\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{N}}}}}=2019$. <br>
Simplify as much as possible, the expression $\frac{\sqrt{N\sqrt{N\sqrt{N\sqrt{N\sqrt{N}}}}}}{N}$.

# Problem 2
The cancellation of the Wimbledon tournament has led to a world surplus of tennis balls, and Santa has decided to use them as stocking fillers. He comes down the chimney with $n$ identical tennis balls, and he finds $k$ named stockings waiting for him. Let $g(n, k)$ be the number of ways that Santa can put the $n$ balls into the $k$ stockings; for example, $g(2, 2) = 3$, because with two balls and two children, Miriam and Adam, he can give both balls to Miriam, or both to Adam, or he can give them one ball each.
<br>
What is the value of $g(7, 5)$?

# Problem 4
Given the integers $x$, $y$, $z$, satisfy $(\frac{15}{8})^x \times (\frac{16}{9})^y \times (\frac{27}{10})^z = 16$, find the value of $\frac{2x+y}{z-y}$
