1. When two chains are joined end-to-end, they are only as strong as the weaker of the two

This chain has strength 14:

2. When two chains are joined in parallel, they are as strong as the sum of the two.

This chain has strength 15:

Tim has 12 lengths of chain that he wants to make into a single chain by joining pairs of chains in parallel, and then joining these end-to-end.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/static/CAT2Image3.png" style="filter: invert(100%);"/>

The strengths of Tim's 12 lengths of chain are 3, 15, 23, 31, 8, 5, 42, 19, 37, 22, 28 and 9.

What is the strength of the strongest chain he could make?
