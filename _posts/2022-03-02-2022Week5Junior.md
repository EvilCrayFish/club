# Problem 1
Colonel Crackham asked his family at the breakfast table if, without having a dial before them, they could correctly draw in Roman numerals the hours round a clock face. George fell into the trap that catches so any people, of writing the fourth hour as IV, instead of IIII.
<br><br>
Colonel Crackham then asked them to show how a dial may be broken into four parts so that the numerals on each part shall in every case sum to 20. As an example he gave our illustration, where it will be found that the separated numerals on two parts sum to 20, but on the other parts they add up to 19 and 21 respectively, so it fails.

# Problem 2
Marvin had a birthday on Tuesday, May 27 in the leap year $2008$. In what year will his birthday next fall on a Saturday?

<h2>Solution</h2>
$2017$ 
<br><br>
There are $365$ days in a non-leap year. There are $7$ days in a week. Since $365 = 52 \cdot 7 + 1$ (or $365\equiv 1 \pmod{ 7}$), the same date (after February) moves "forward" one day in the subsequent year, if that year is not a leap year.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
$5/27/08$ Tue
<br><br>
$5/27/09$ Wed
<br><br>
However, a leap year has $366$ days, and $366 = 52 \cdot 7 + 2$ . So the same date (after February) moves "forward" two days in the subsequent year, if that year is a leap year.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
$5/27/11$ Fri
<br><br>
$5/27/12$ Sun
<br><br>
You can keep counting forward to find that the first time this date falls on a Saturday is in $2017$:
<br><br>
$5/27/13$ Mon
<br><br>
$5/27/14$ Tue
<br><br>
$5/27/15$ Wed
<br><br>
$5/27/16$ Fri
<br><br>
$5/27/17$ Sat

# Problem 3
On Mr. White's magic monthly calendar, the date behind one of the letters is added to the date behind $\text{C}$. If this sum equals the sum of the dates behind $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$, then what is the letter?

<h2>Solution</h2>
Let the date behind $C$ be $x$. Now the date behind $A$ is $x+1$, and after looking at the calendar, the date behind $B$ is $x+13$. Now we have $x+1+x+13=x+y$ for some date $y$, and we desire for $y$ to be $x+14$. Now we find that $y$ is the date behind $P$.
