Helen likes hopping in her garden which is tiled with hexagonal pavers. She starts on the paver with the * and with each hop lands on a new paver next to the one from which she hopped. She does not hop over any flower beds, which are marked with dark double lines.

Her favourite pavers are the ones that require the greatest number of hops to reach, using the shortest route.

In this diagram, how many favourite pavers does Helen have?
