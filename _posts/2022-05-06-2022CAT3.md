You are a werewolf. You have two forms: human form and wolf form. Currently you are in wolf form. You have a journey to make. At the end of the journey, you must be in human form. During the journey you have to transform (from wolf to human) exactly once.

Living as a werewolf is not easy.

- <p>You must avoid graveyards <img style="vertical-align:middle; display:inline;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/static/CAT3Image1.png"/> when you are in human form.</p>
- <p>You must avoid churches <img style="vertical-align:middle; display:inline;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/static/CAT3Image2.png"/> when you are in wolf form.</p>
- <p>You can only transform in a castle <img style="vertical-align:middle; display:inline;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/static/CAT3Image3.png"/></p>
- <p>You can pass through a castle in either wolf form or human form.</p>

You are in the castle at the far left, and your journey is to the castle at the far right. You can only travel from left to right.
