# Problem 1
For which integers $0 \le k \le 9$ do there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ so that the number $3^m + 3^n + k$ is a perfect square?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
We see that $k=0,3,4,6,7$ work through the following: <br>
$3^3+3^2+0=36$ <br>
$3^1+3^1+3=9$ <br>
$3^2+3^1+4=16$ <br>
$3^3+3^1+6=36$ <br>
$3^2+3^2+7=25$ <br>
<br><br>
$k=2,5,8$ doesn't work because of $\mod 3$. $k=1$ doesn't work because of $\mod 8$. If $k=9$ worked and $m,n>1$, we could divide the expression by $9$ and get that $k=1$ works, which is untrue. WLOG $m=1$, then we can show $3^n+12$ can't be a square. By $\mod 4$ we have to have $n$ even, but then $3^n$ and $3^n+12$ are both squares, which implies $3^n=4$ and is impossible. Thus $k=0,3,4,6,7$ is the answer.
