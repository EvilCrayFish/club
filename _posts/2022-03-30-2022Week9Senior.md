# Problem 1
The smallest possible integer $n$ such that

$$
1-2+3-4+5-6+\cdots+(-1)^{n+1}n\ge100,
$$

is

$$
\textbf{(a)}\ 99\qquad\textbf{(b)}\ 101\qquad\textbf{(c)}\ 199\qquad\textbf{(d)}\ 300
$$

Summing the first few terms of the series

$$
1-2+3-4+5-6+\cdots+(-1)^{n+1}n,
$$

we see that we get the sequence

$$
1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,4,-4,5,-5,6,-6,\cdots,
$$

The first time this equals to or exceeds $100$ is when $n = 199$ <br>
$\therefore$ the answer is $\boxed{(c)}$

# Problem 2
In how many ways can three different numbers be selected from the integers $1, 2, 3, \cdots , 23, 24$ so that their sum is exactly divisible by $3$?

The numbers can be divided into three sets of $8$, such that in the first set we have the numbers 0 mod 3, in the second set we have the numbers 1 mod 3 and in the third set we have the numbers 2 mod 3. That is to say, the first set contains $3,6,9,\cdots,24$. the second contains $1,4,7,\cdots,22$, and the third contains $2,5,\cdots,23$. A sum of three numbers divisible by three can be done four wavs.
You can take three numbers from one set, (and there are $3$ sets), or one number from each of the three sets. Taking three distinct numbers from a set can be done in $8$ choose $3$ = 56 ways. Choosing one number from each set can be done in $8^3$ = 512 wavs. So the total number of wavs is $3 \times 56 + 512 = 680$
