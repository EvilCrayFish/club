Each day Penelope has a list of chores to do. But when she completes one chore more are added to the end of her list. How totally unfair!

The chores are of types $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ and $E$. The two new chores are always of the next type. So a finished $A$ is replaced by two $B$s, a finished $B$ by two $C$s, and so on. Luckily, there are no chores of type $F$!

For example, if her list started with $B$ $E$ $D$, she would have more chores to do after completing $B$, $E$ and $D$.

$$
BED \rightarrow \cancel{B}EDCC \rightarrow \cancel{B}\cancel{E}DCC \rightarrow \cancel{B}\cancel{E}\cancel{D}CCEE \rightarrow \cdots
$$

How many chores must Penelope do to completely cross out the following lists?

$$
\textbf{(a)}\ \text{E D E D E}\qquad\textbf{(b)}\ \text{A C E D E D E}
$$

$$
\qquad\textbf{(c)}\ \text{A B B A E E E A C D C}
$$
