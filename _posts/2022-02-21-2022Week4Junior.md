# Problem 1
In $\bigtriangleup ABC$, $D$ is a point on side $\overline{AC}$ such that $BD=DC$ and $\angle BCD$ measures $70^\circ$. What is the degree measure of $\angle ADB$?

<h2>Solution</h2>
$BD = DC$, so $\angle DBC = \angle DCB = 70$. Then $\angle CDB = 180-(70+70) = 40$. Since $\angle ADB$ and $\angle BDC$ are supplementary, $\angle ADB = 180 - 40 = \boxed{140}$.<br>

# Problem 2
Rectangle $ABCD$ and right triangle $DCE$ have the same area. They are joined to form a trapezoid, as shown. What is $DE$?

<h2>Solution 1</h2>
The area of $\bigtriangleup CDE$ is $\frac{DC\cdot CE}{2}$. The area of $ABCD$ is $AB\cdot AD=5\cdot 6=30$, which also must be equal to the area of $\bigtriangleup CDE$, which, since $DC=5$, must in turn equal $\frac{5\cdot CE}{2}$. Through transitivity, then, $\frac{5\cdot CE}{2}=30$, and $CE=12$. Then, using the Pythagorean Theorem, you should be able to figure out that $\bigtriangleup CDE$ is a $5-12-13$ triangle, so $DE=\boxed{13}$.
<br><br>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
The area of the rectangle is $5\times6=30.$ Since the parallel line pairs are identical, $DC=5$. Let $CE$ be $x$. $\dfrac{5x}{2}=30$ is the area of the right triangle. Solving for $x$, we get $x=12.$ According to the Pythagorean Theorem, we have a $5-12-13$ triangle. So, the hypotenuse $DE$ has to be $\boxed{13}$.
<br><br>

<h2>Solution 3</h2>
This problem can be solved with the Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2). We know AB = DC, so DC = 5. CE is twice the length of AD, so CE = 12. 5^2 + 12^2 = c^2. 5^2 = 25. 12^2 = 144. 25 + 144 = 169. 169 has a square root of 13, so the hypotenuse or DE is 13.

# Problem 3
Three teachers decided to steal some apples from poor Ms Saul in order to satisfy their apple addiction! Chris seized half of the apples, but returned ten to the basket. Sam took one-third of what were left, but returned two that were too soft for his liking. Linda took half of the remainder, but threw back one that was worm-eaten. Ms Saul was then left with only a grim looking basket of 12 apples. <br>
How many apples did she have before the raid was made?

# Problem 4
Ms Xue the other morning asked her brother this question: "If three boys had a hundred and sixty-nine apples which they shared in the ratio of one-half, one-third, and one-fourth, how many apples did each receive?"

<h2>Solution</h2>
The ratio is 6, 4, and 3, which sum to 13 units. Therefore the boys receive 78, 52, and 39 apples.
